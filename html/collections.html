      <p><strong>Notable Inscriptions or Symbols:</strong> Etched geometric designs mirror patterns seen in later Mesoamerican cultures, though predating them by over 20,000 years.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="field-group">
      <p><strong>Anomalous or Unexplained Features:</strong> Material isotopes suggest obsidian was sourced from over 3,000 km away in what is now northeastern Russia.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="field-group">
      <p><strong>Anomalous or Unexplained Features:</strong> Fusion material is not naturally occurring in the local environment and exhibits qualities of engineered bio-ceramics; the body survived post-trauma for decades based on growth rings.</p>
      <p><strong>Connections to Other Artifacts or Findings:</strong> Healing patterns echo those found on modified bear femurs from the Glacier Tooth Site, thought to be part of the same cultural complex.</p>
      <p><strong>Curatorial Notes:</strong> This specimen challenges existing models of Ice Age medical knowledge; its display features interactive overlays of nerve regeneration models and reconstructed mobility simulations.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="field-group">
      <p><strong>Hypothesized Use or Function:</strong> Primary living and storage structure for a multi-generational agrarian household; likely served as a combined shelter, granary, and ritual hearth site.</p>
      <p><strong>Condition Upon Discovery:</strong> Fragmentary remains—posthole patterns, carbonized thatch fragments, and compressed clay flooring provided enough evidence for architectural extrapolation.</p>
      <p><strong>Methods of Analysis Used:</strong> Thermoluminescence dating, aerial subglacial LIDAR, botanical residue analysis, and magnetic stratigraphy.</p>
      <p><strong>Notable Inscriptions or Symbols:</strong> Ornate geomorphic patterns carved into lintels and doorframe, interpreted as protective symbols referencing fertility and seasonal cycles.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="field-group">
      <p><strong>Anomalous or Unexplained Features:</strong> Interior baskets contain traces of hybrid cereal grains with no known modern analog; genetic markers suggest bioengineering predating known Neolithic techniques.</p>
      <p><strong>Connections to Other Artifacts or Findings:</strong> Architectural motifs and grain types closely match subterranean granary remnants at the nearby Naruuk Terrace site.</p>
      <p><strong>Curatorial Notes:</strong> This reconstruction synthesizes data from over a dozen excavation sites and reflects current interdisciplinary hypotheses on domestic life in pre-Holocene agrarian societies. Interior objects are replicated using traditional techniques sourced from analogous ethnographic examples.</p>
