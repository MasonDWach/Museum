      <h2>Dr. Caelum Voss</h2>
      <h3>Geoarchaeologist</h3>
      <p>
        Dr. Caelum Voss earned his PhD in Geoarchaeology from the University of Edinburgh, studying under glacial mapping pioneer Dr. Isla Renn. Known for his meticulous excavation methods and use of ground-penetrating radar and 3D mapping drones, Voss has uncovered submerged megalithic structures predating the Younger Dryas. His skills span from sediment analysis to stratigraphic reconstruction. In the field, he’s calm, methodical, and deeply curious—often sketching his hypotheses in a worn leather notebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Museum Role:</strong> Leads field missions for the museum’s Pre-Ice Age Cultures Initiative, overseeing artifact recovery and excavation protocols.<br>
        <strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Multilingual researcher fluent in Latin, Russian, and Inuktituk. Recipient of the Royal Anthropological Fellowship.

      <h2>Dr. Lina Mercado</h2>
      <h3>Physical Anthropologist</h3>
      <p>
        Dr. Lina Mercado specializes in analyzing ancient human remains to reconstruct lifestyles and health conditions of Ice Age populations. She holds a PhD from the University of Buenos Aires and uses cutting-edge DNA sequencing and forensic analysis in her work. Known for her methodical approach and passion for uncovering the human story from the deep past, she navigates the challenges of studying remains with limited cultural context.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Museum Role:</strong> Oversees skeletal collections and collaborates with field teams on excavation strategies.<br>
        <strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Dr. Mercado, has received the prestigious Paleoanthropology Excellence Award and a Fulbright Research Fellowship for her groundbreaking DNA analyses of Pre-Ice Age human remains. She earned the Ethical Forensics Commendation for her work in culturally respectful handling of skeletal collections.

      <h2>Dr. Jasper Kade</h2>
      <h3>Comparative Mythologist</h3>
      <p>
        Jasper Kade studies connections between Ice Age civilizations and modern cultures. With a PhD in Cultural Anthropology, he uses research and AI to explore how ancient myths and symbols may have spread over time. Jasper challenges the idea that these societies were isolated, showing their influence in languages and folklore today. He works with archaeologists and artists to create exhibits highlighting cultural continuity. Jasper balances careful research with creative interpretation and welcomes the unknown in his work.      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Interpretive Method:</strong> He compares archaeological finds with global myths, uses AI to model cultural diffusion, and collaborates across fields to tell stories of human connection.<br>
        <strong>Special Considerations:</strong> Dr. Jasper Kade applies a decolonial lens to myth interpretation, often challenging dominant museum narratives and advocating for repatriation of culturally active objects. A queer scholar, he embraces uncertainty and collaborates across disciplines to highlight cultural continuity. His work has sparked debate with traditional researchers over symbolic meaning and ethical responsibility.
